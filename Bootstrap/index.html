			<h2>HISTORIA</h2>
			<p>LOONA is a South Korean girl group formed by Blockberry Creative (BBC). The girl group was revealed in a periodic fashion, corresponding to their Korean name Idarui Sonyeo (이달의 소녀) which translates to "Girl of the Month". LOONA consists of twelve members; HeeJin, HyunJin, HaSeul, YeoJin, ViVi, Kim Lip, JinSoul, Choerry, Yves, Chuu, Go Won and Olivia Hye. Each release from all members helped build the LOONAVERSE of LOONA which is LOONA's concept and is still ongoing at this time.<br>
			LOONA officially debuted on August 19, 2018 with the title track "Hi High" from their first album release as a group "[+ +]". On February 19, 2019 "[+ +]" was repackaged under the name "[X X]" with the title track "Butterfly". December 13, 2019 was a special date for Orbits as LOONA had released the single "365" for their fans to say thank you for waiting due to company related issues. Finally, on February 5th 2020, LOONA came back with their second third named "#" with the title song "So What".</p>
